# LDPC-Decoding
The project is about encoding and mainly decoding part of LDPC Codes.  
Decoding is performed using Message passing algorithms with the use of graph data structure.  
This is a group project for the Communication course under Professor Yash Vasavada and mentor Vansh Joshi.  
We have implemented both hard-decision and soft-decision decoding techniques in MATLAB.  
LDPC codes are widely used in modern communication systems for reliable error correction.  
Our work demonstrates the practical application of channel coding concepts studied in
